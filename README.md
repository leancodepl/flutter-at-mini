### Timeline
- 08.11.2024 - [Initial documentation](#initial-documentation)
- 28.01.2025 - Project Submission (source code + [final documentation](#final-documentation)
- 12.02.2025 - [Late Project Submission](#late-project-submission)

### Initial Documentation
Initial documentation should contain:
- Project description
- Desired optional requirements should be listed in the initial documentation
- User stories (e.g. As a user, I can sign in; As a user, I can view the list of items)

### Final Documentation
Final documentation should contain:
- Project description
- Integrations
- List of optional requirements
- Instruction
- Test account (if applicable)
- Database/Firestore schema (if applicable)
- CI/CD description/screenshot (if applicable)

But it shouldn't be longer than 1-2 pages. :)

### Late Project Submission
Students can submit the project until 09.02.2024. Each day of being late will take a decrease of 5pt from the total number of gained points (not less than 51pts). Projects submitted after the final deadline won't be accepted.
