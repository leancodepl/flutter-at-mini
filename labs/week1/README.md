1. Lists & sets
    1. Create a list of 30 random integers between 0 and 20 (use the `Random`
       class).
    2. Sort the list in descending order.
    3. Filter the list, so that it contains only numbers divisible by 3.
    4. Remove duplicates from the list (i.e., make a set out of it).
    5. Print each element, its index in the list, and whether it is even or odd.
2. Maps
    1. Create a collection of Strings (e.g., names, cities, etc.).
    2. Create a map that maps each string to its length.
    3. Group the elements by their first letter. [`package:collection`] might be
       useful here.

1. Define a following class hierarchy of animals.
   All animals have an age and a name. Their `description` should include these
   two fields.

   *Make sure that `Dog`, `Cat` and `Cow` are the **only** animals allowed in
   this hierarchy.*

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title:
    ---
    classDiagram
        class Animal {
            int age
            String name
            get String description
            void makeSound()*
        }

        Animal <|-- Dog
        class Dog {
            String color
        }

        Animal <|-- Cat
        class Cat {
            String color
        }

        Animal <|-- Cow
        class Cow {
            int weight
        }
    ```

2. Create a list of various animals.
   Iterate over this list and make every animal make a sound. Also, for each
   animal, print its additional fields like `color` or `weight`.

   *Use pattern matching to simplify matching subclasses and reading their
   properties.*
