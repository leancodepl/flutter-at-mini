<details>
<summary><h3>1. Hello, Dart!</h3></summary>

1. Create a simple Q&A program.
    1. Ask the user ([`stdin`]) about their name and favorite color. You can
       add more questions.
    2. Then, print a greeting using their data.

2. Print a triangle of asterisks, something like this:

   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ******
   *******
   ```

<summary><h3>2. Collections</h3></summary>

[`package:collection`] might be useful.

1. Lists & sets
    1. Create a list of 30 random integers between 0 and 20 (use the `Random`
       class).
    2. Sort the list in descending order.
    3. Filter the list, so that it contains only numbers divisible by 3.
    4. Remove duplicates from the list (i.e., make a set out of it).
    5. Print each element, its index in the list, and whether it is even or odd.
2. Maps
    1. Create a collection of Strings (e.g., names, cities, etc.).
    2. Create a map that maps each string to its length.
    3. Group the elements by their first letter.

<summary><h3>3. Object-oriented programming</h3></summary>

1. Define a following class hierarchy of animals.
   All animals have an age and a name. Their `description` should include these
   two fields.

   *Make sure that `Dog`, `Cat` and `Cow` are the **only** animals allowed in
   this hierarchy.*

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title:
    ---
    classDiagram
        class Animal {
            int age
            String name
            get String description
            void makeSound()*
        }

        Animal <|-- Dog
        class Dog {
            String color
        }

        Animal <|-- Cat
        class Cat {
            String color
        }

        Animal <|-- Cow
        class Cow {
            int weight
        }
    ```

   Example usage:

   ```dart
   final myDog = Dog('Rex', age: 3, color: 'brown');
   final aCow = Cow('Betsy', age: 5, weight: 500);
   ```

2. Create a list of various animals.
   Iterate over this list and make every animal make a sound. Also, for each
   animal, print its additional fields like `color` or `weight`.

   *Use pattern matching to simplify matching subclasses and reading their
   properties.*

<summary><h3>4. Generics</h3></summary>

1. Define a generic `Container` class that holds a single value.

   Example usage:

   ```dart
   final intContainer = Container<int>(42);
   final stringContainer = Container<String>('Hello, world!');
   ```

   Make sure `null` ***cannot*** be stored in the container, i.e. the type
   parameter is not nullable:

   ```dart
   // This shouldn't compile
   final invalid = Container<String?>(null);
   ```

2. Create a list of various containers. Then loop over them: if the contained
   value is a number, print its square. If it's a string, print its length.

<details>
<summary><h3>5. Records</h3></summary>

1. Define a function called `generate` that returns a random triple of integers.

2. Define a function called `transform` that accepts a triple of integers and:
    1. If all values are 0, ***returns*** `"All zeros!"`.
    2. If the first value is greater than 10 and the second one is equal to 5,
       ***returns*** the third one.
    3. If the first value is even, ***returns*** the first and second values.
    4. Else, ***returns*** the entire triple.
   
   ***Don't use `if` statements in this function.***

   *Try to define `transform` with the arrow syntax `=> ...`.*

3. Define a function called `randomize` that returns a random record of:
    * Two integers `x` and `y`
    * A boolean `enabled`
    * A double `temperature`

4. Read the four values from `randomize` into variables inside `part6` without
   creating any additional variables or using property access (i.e. `obj.prop`).
